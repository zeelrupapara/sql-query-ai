5. Start asking questions about your data

## System Architecture

### Core Components:

1. **Query Processing Pipeline**
   - Natural language understanding
   - Query classification
   - SQL generation
   - Result visualization

2. **Authentication System**
   - User registration
   - Login/logout functionality
   - Session management

3. **Data Management**
   - SQLite database handling
   - Schema extraction
   - Query caching

### Key Functions:

- `process_query()`: Main pipeline for handling user questions
- `classify_query()`: Determines if question can be answered with available data
- `generate_sql()`: Converts natural language to SQL
- `create_visualization()`: Generates appropriate charts for results

## Example Questions (Any Question Can be asked related to Database or Non-DB related)

- "Show me sales trends over the last 6 months"
- "Which products have the highest profit margin?"
- "Compare performance across different regions"
- "What are the top 10 customers by revenue?"

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key
- SQLite database
- Required packages listed in requirements.txt
